Download and install mingw and msys (base configuration for each).
I used msys 1.0 and mingw "TDM-GCC 4.7.1 32-bit".

Add to windows path.
Run the following commands in the cflow distribution directory-
>bash configure
>make

After building, executable is available under src.
Prebuilt executable stored under /cflow-mingw.
